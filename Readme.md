## Attention Abstractive Summarization


This ongoing project is an implementation of an abstractive summarizer model which was introduced by Rush et al. in the paper titled [A Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Sentence Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00685.pdf). The implementation is greatly inspired by the lectures of Graham Neubig, Yoav Goldberg and [toru34/rush_emnlp_2015](https://github.com/toru34/rush_emnlp_2015).
